[Augmented Reality Hand Tracking with Unity](https://github.com/polymitis/hand-gamepad)
==========================

This repository, titled "XR playground," is an experimental project aimed at developing a hand-based gamepad using Unity and Mediapipe. It includes submodules and directories related to Blender and Mediapipe for 3D modelling and hand-tracking functionalities. The project leverages C#, Objective-C, and Makefile, focusing on creating an immersive XR (Extended Reality) experience. As part of this project, the [mp-hand-gesture-detector](https://github.com/polymitis/mp-hand-gesture-detector) subproject focuses on detecting hand gestures using Mediapipe. It provides scripts and models for recognizing various hand gestures, which can be integrated into applications needing hand gesture recognition. The [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5Hi7LZ-N1Y) demonstrates the functionality and implementation of the hand-gamepad project, showcasing how hand gestures can be tracked and utilized as inputs for controlling virtual elements in an XR environment.
